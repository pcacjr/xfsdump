xfsdump-3.0.0 (4 February 2009)
	- Bump major package version number to signify changed
	  dependencies and moved binaries (xfs_fsr and estimate
	  have moved into xfsprogs).
	- xfsdump should no longer make use of internal XFS
	  headers and libraries, in particular no use of libxfs
	  is permitted in this package anymore (such detailed
	  on-disk format knowledge is the realm of xfsprogs).

xfsdump-2.2.49 (17 Feb 2008)
	- Fix up error handling in _rmt_open in librmt.
	  Warnings reported by Michal Marek <mmarek@novell.com>

xfsdump-2.2.48 (07 Feb 2008)
	- Prune dump sessions with 0 media files even when using -m.

xfsdump-2.2.47 (01 Feb 2008)
	- Correctly detect whether a tape device is in variable or
	  fixed block mode when using the TS tape driver.

xfsdump-2.2.46 (24 Aug 2007)
	- Specify mode on all open(2) calls that use O_CREAT.

xfsdump-2.2.45 (24 May 2007)
	- Change fsr's temp directory mode to 0700 to deny full access.
	- Update fsr's usage text.

xfsdump-2.2.44 (01 February 2007)
	- Fix use of getopt's optopt variable. Thanks to Kouta Ooizumi.
	- Initialize xfsdump's logging facility earlier. Thanks to
	  Kouta Ooizumi.
	- Log a message for each quota file restored, not just the first.
	- When using -z, check a file's size against the max dump file
	  size just before dumping the file, rather than only during the
	  initial scan, to account for changes during the dump.
	- A sync needs to be issued before the first inode scan to avoid
	  potentially skipping modified files in an incremental dump.

xfsdump-2.2.43 (02 October 2006)
	- Change the inode scans to seek to the next inode of
	  interest, rather than always doing a full scan. Useful
	  for dumps that contain only a subset of the inodes
	  in a filesystem (incrementals, subtree dumps, etc.).
	- Produce a more accurate dump size estimate when
	  it is worthwhile to do so (when using multiple dump
	  streams or when skipping files based on size).

xfsdump-2.2.42 (08 August 2006)
	- Rework code to remove the DMAPI build and run-time dependency.

xfsdump-2.2.41 (14 July 2006)
	- Fix issues with makedepend on libtool libraries.
	- Fix issues with symbolic link handling in Makefiles.

xfsdump-2.2.40 (05 July 2006)
	- Update translation Makefile to work better with the Ubuntu
	  translation system.  Thanks to feedback from Martin Pitt.
	- Fix annoying "ignores datarootdir" warning from configure.
	- Fix issues with makedepend build infrastructure.

xfsdump-2.2.39 (21 June 2006)
	- Fix for parallel compiles, thanks to Robin H. Johnson.

xfsdump-2.2.38 (06 June 2006)
	- Performance improvements for dumping subtrees.

xfsdump-2.2.37 (24 May 2006)
	- Fix xfs_fsr memory and file descriptor leaks.
	- Fix xfs_fsr handling some of the extended inode flags
	  and fields (like project IDs, extsize, realtime, etc).
	- Fix Debian packaging for libc-dev build dependency.
	- Fix up auto lib64 install detection for x86_64 platforms.
	- Use -O2 optimisation by default now like everywhere else.
	- Default to using a single media file for each strategy.
	  Multiple media files can be enabled on tape strategies
	  by using the -d option.
	- Fix a bug in restoring multiple links to files with the
	  immutable bit set.
	- Fix a regression that caused xfsrestore to fail when
	  restoring files that were changing during the dump.
	- Remove some overhead in restoring files that were dumped
	  in multiple extent groups (> 16 MiB).
	- Add simple interface to HSM-specific code in xfsrestore,
	  similar to that already in xfsdump.
	- Fix fsr mishandling directories given as arguments.
	- Fix build dependency on recent xfsprogs header files.

xfsdump-2.2.36 (15 February 2006)
	- Debian packaging updates (debmake out, debhelper in).
	- Minor man page fixups with respect to hyphenation.

xfsdump-2.2.35 (07 February 2006)
	- Merge some minor changes in from IRIX.

xfsdump-2.2.34 (31 January 2006)
	- Updated the spec file to correctly set package user/group.
	- Optimizations to increase the performance of xfsdump and
	  xfsrestore, especially on filesystems with millions of inodes.
	  Many small changes were made to minimize the number of system
	  calls required per inode.
	- Significant changes to xfsdump:
	  o Cache the gen number of each inode during the initial inode
	    scan so that a bulkstat single does not need to be done for
	    each inode when dumping directories.
	  o No longer retrieve the DMF attribute when estimating the dump
	    size of a file. Use information from the bulkstat instead.
	  o Retrieve DMF attribute by handle instead of doing
	    open/attr_getf/close.
	  o In determining where to split multi-stream dumps, take into
	    consideration the number of files and not just the file size.
	    This allows filesystems with large amounts of inodes but
	    relatively little data (DMF filesystem) to be split correctly.
	- Significant changes to xfsrestore:
	  o Buffer writes to the namreg file to eliminate 2 very small
	    write system calls per directory entry.
	  o Buffer writes to dirattr file to eliminate a small write system
	    call per directory.
	  o Speedup the check to see if a particular window of the tree
	    file is mapped. This allows xfsrestore to use more, smaller
	    windows which is beneficial if we can't fit them all in memory
	    and have to start unmapping them. This also makes the -w
	    option obsolete so that option now has no effect.
	  o Change the hash function to give a better distribution among
	    the hash buckets.
	  o Do not make an unnecessary unlink call if the file being
	    restored does not already exist.

xfsdump-2.2.33 (16 December 2005)
	- Add option to allow dump time to be overridden.
	  Useful if doing incremental dumps of snapshots.
	  Thanks to David Brown.

xfsdump-2.2.32 (29 November 2005)
	- Dump and restore project ids and project quotas.
	- Remove xfsdq(8) and xfsrq(8); use xfs_quota(8) to dump and
	  restore quotas now.
	- Fix the setting of extended inode flags during restore.
	  Some flags must be set before writing file data, and others
	  must be set after writing file data and extended attributes.

xfsdump-2.2.31 (10 November 2005)
	- Sync up build system (m4 macros, etc) with other projects
	- Update SGI copyright/licence notices

xfsdump-2.2.30 (27 July 2005)
	- Fix some problems in the xfsrq(8) script, thanks to Kim Hansen.

xfsdump-2.2.29 (23 June 2005)
	- Change xfsrestore to retry a write that fails with ENOSPC
	  after issuing a fdatasync call. If it still fails, issue
	  a sync call and retry once more.

xfsdump-2.2.28 (03 June 2005)
	- removal of unnecessary stat64_to_xfsbstat function

xfsdump-2.2.27 (08 March 2005)
	- Fix compilation with gcc4, from Andreas Jochens.

xfsdump-2.2.26 (09 February 2005)
	- Fix xfsrestore so that it can restore to non-XFS filesystems again.

xfsdump-2.2.25 (13 October 2004)
	- Bump the version to deal with the mixup in 2.2.23-lbs
	  (that fix was missing from the 2.2.23/2.2.24 versions).

xfsdump-2.2.23-lbs (04 October 2004)
	- Fix a problem dumping DMF filesystems when files change
	  from dual-state to offline during the dump.

xfsdump-2.2.24 (29 Sep 2004)
	- Update m4 macros, incorporating some portability changes.

xfsdump-2.2.23 (21 Jul 2004)
	- Fix up xfs_fsr and xfsdump to prevent possible crashes on 64 bit
	  machines such as Alphas, when using a 64 bit count passed to bulkstat
	  when only 32 bits of it have been set by bulkstat.
	  Suggestion came from Jan-Jaap van der Heijden.
	  See http://oss.sgi.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=346 for details.

xfsdump-2.2.22 (19 Jul 2004)
	- Add support for new DMF attribute format.
	- Fix bug in HSM code where a DMF attribute
	  could be generated for both the root and
	  secure extended attribute namespaces.

xfsdump-2.2.21 (15 Apr 2004)
	- Always allocate a filesystem handle on restore instead of
	  doing so only when restoring DMAPI events, as the filesystem
	  handle is also needed if restoring extended attrs.
	- Remove path_to_fshandle calls in tree.c. These existed to
	  ensure that we always had a fshandle before calling
	  open_by_handle. These calls are extraneous since we now
	  allocate a fshandle during context_init.
	- Change open_by_fshandle calls to open_by_handle since
	  we are passing a file handle, not a fshandle.

xfsdump-2.2.20 (31 March 2004)
	- fix up "xfs_invutil -i" which was getting segmentation faults on
	  presumably long session labels.
	  See http://oss.sgi.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=320.
	  Become paranoid and convert all sprintf's to snprintf's.

xfsdump-2.2.19 (23 March 2004)
	- rearrange fsr algorithm to not copy data unless extent
	  count has been improved.  Suggested by Chris Wedgwood
	  <cw at f00f dot org> and Utz Lehmann <xfs at s2y4n2c dot de>

xfsdump-2.2.18 (25 February 2004)
	- add support for the security extended attributes namespace

xfsdump-2.2.17 (13 February 2004)
	- modify calls to libhandle subroutines to account for
	  changes to the libhandle library.

xfsdump-2.2.16 (05 December 2003)
	- fix xfsrestore to restore new XFS inode flags:  immutable,
	  append, sync, noatime and nodump.  The inode flags have also
	  been added to the _mk_fillconfig_ea() routine in common.dump,
	  called by QA test 063 to test inode flags and xattrs.
	- fix xfsdump to honor the new nodump xflag, "XFS_XFLAG_NODUMP",
	  (in conjunction with -e).  The original method to skip files,
	  -e plus extended attribute "SGI_XFSDUMP_SKIP_FILE", is still
	  supported.  Admins may choose which method to use.  The
	  xfsdump man page has been updated to document these changes.
	- update man pages with a more detailed description of the
	  inventory media file that gets written to the end of each dump.
	- remove 'miniroot' reference from xfsdump man page.

xfsdump-2.2.15 (18 December 2003)
	- a mod was added in 2.2.13 to fix the way xfsdump handles
	  multiple dump sessions to a single tape.  The mod fixed
	  problems that the TS tape driver was hitting but actually
	  broke multiple backup functionality using the ST tape
	  driver.  Both problems (ST and TS) are fixed in 2.2.15.

xfsdump-2.2.14 (18 October 2003)
	- update Debian packaging to require latest dmapi packages.

xfsdump-2.2.13 (21 July 2003)
	- fix ST/TS tape driver compatibility issues in drive_scsitape.
	- fix multiple backups to a single tape (TS AND ST).

xfsdump-2.2.12 (29 May 2003)
	- fix up an invutil Makefile botch which was effectively
	  disabling the optional ncurses support (interactive mode).

xfsdump-2.2.11 (26 April 2003)
	- rework configure.in to make use of shared macros.
	- fix up #include lines to allow compilation of sources
	  with installed headers rather than local headers.
	- update Debian packaging.
	- fix up a botch in the RPM packaging from 2.2.8.

xfsdump-2.2.10 (14 April 2003)
	- fix configure tests that used AC_PATH_PROG incorrectly.
	- switch from using mktemp to using mkstemp for xfs_copy log.
	- use a FHS compliant name for the xfs_copy log file.

xfsdump-2.2.9 (27 March 2003)
	- add -f option to xfsdq(8) to specify an output file instead
	  of using the standard output stream.  This file is created
	  by xfsdq and xfsdq will fail to run if it exists already.
	  The file is also created with a more appropriate mode than
	  whatever the umask happened to be when xfsdump(8) was run.

xfsdump-2.2.8 (27 March 2003)
	- cleanups to the build process, in particular the automatic
	  rpm package generation Makefile and spec file template.
	- Makepkgs script can now propagate failures back from make.

xfsdump-2.2.7 (13 March 2003)
	- add initial support for TS tape driver.
	  (19 February 2003)
	- fix xfsdump -I option to set correct fsid.

xfsdump-2.2.6 (19 December 2002)
	- add initial internationalisation support.

xfsdump-2.2.5 (19 December 2002)
	- fix build fallout from macro changes in XFS headers.
	- add a configure check so that we don't attempt to build
	  against old versions of the headers.

xfsdump-2.2.4 (08 November 2002)
	- configure now looks for, and xfsinvutil uses, the ncurses
	  header and library rather than the curses version - this
	  resolves an issue in those distributions that don't make
	  the compatibility library available.

xfsdump-2.2.3 (31 October 2002)
	- minor update to Debian packaging dependencies.
	- inventory related bugfix.

xfsdump-2.2.2 (03 October 2002)
	- Remove fork/setuid from fsr.  Just chown temp. file to owner.
	  This gets fsr working again with the restricted RESVSP ioctl.
	  Chris Wedgwood <cw at f00f dot org>

xfsdump-2.2.1 (24 September 2002)
	- minor troff-version-specific fixups for xfsrestore(8).

xfsdump-2.2.0 (03 September 2002)
	- force use of version 1 XFS geometry ioctl everywhere in xfsdump
	  package, so that these tools can still work on older kernels
	  (they don't need the additional information in the new ioctl).
	- added new config.h.in and configure changes to implement this.
	- do some additional cleanup after autoconf has run.

xfsdump-2.1.5 (14 August 2002)
	- minor build fix when using relatively old versions of glibc
	  which don't provide the SYS_getdents64 symbol.

xfsdump-2.1.4 (01 August 2002)
	- xfsinvutil -m option added (merge from IRIX).
	- add missing GPL/copyright headers to several xfsinvutil files.
	- correct several uses of uuid_compare in xfsinvutil.

xfsdump-2.1.3 (30 July 2002)
	- small xfsinvutil fixups to preserve compatibility with old -n
	  option.
	- fixed all new xfsinvutil warnings on 64bit platforms

xfsdump-2.1.2 (29 July 2002)
	- xfsinvutil interactive mode
	- merge of a dump/restore fix from IRIX - test if a child exited
	  with error and if a child did, set the exit_code to EXIT_ERROR.

xfsdump-2.1.1 (04 July 2002)
	- build infrastructure updates so that configure options can be
	  used to specify paths rather than semi-hard-coded path names
	  controlled by the ROOT/ROOT_PREFIX environment variables; eg.
	  now allows /lib64 and /lib32

xfsdump-2.1.0 (14 June 2002)
	- new fsinfo system call used, mostly changing version to
	  differentiate this.

xfsdump-2.0.4 (14 June 2002)
	- fix xfsrestore/xfsdump version output to report both
	  their version and the respective dump format version. They
	  will report their version from cmd/xfsdump/VERSION.
	- changed the messages printed out for the xfsrestore
	  interactive mode to emphasize the restore is interactive.

xfsdump-2.0.3 (08 May 2002)
	- fix xfsdump so that it does not cause segmentation fault
	  when media specific object id (OPT_MOBJID) is specified
	  with -I option.
	- fix similar code for filesystem id (OPT_FSID) option.

xfsdump-2.0.2 (08 May 2002)
	- in xfsdump, check for ERANGE as well as E2BIG for testing
	  of the existence of the SGI_XFSDUMP_SKIP_FILE extended
	  attribute. This only affects dumping using the -e option.
	  This was motivated by an XFS kernel change from returning
	  E2BIG into returning ERANGE.
	- fix "xfsdump -v silent" to really be silent

xfsdump-2.0.1 (13 April 2002)
	- minor build system updates

xfsdump-2.0.0 (07 February 2002)
	- rework all code dealing with extended attributes to use
	  the new system calls (requires attr-2.0.0 or greater)
	- also, the attrctl-by-handle ioctl is history, replaced
	  by libhandle routines - more like what we have in IRIX
	  (requires xfsprogs-2.0.0 or greater)
	- effectively no-op change (cleanup) - switch over to using
	  XFS_IOC_FSGEOMETRY instead of XFS_IOC_GETFSUUID ioctl, so
	  we can deprecate that "special" UUID ioctl in the kernel.
	- add -q description to xfsdump/xfsrestore man pages and
	  usage text.
	- change failed bulkstat WARNING to a TRACE message to that
	  it doesn't bother people.
	- avoid a possible assertion failure for cumulative restores
	  with -B option.

xfsdump-1.1.14 (16 January 2002)
	- fix xfsrestore so that cumulative restores (with -r)
	  will successfully delete removed directories whose
	  files have also been removed.
	  Previously, the files weren't removed until later,
	  which meant that early directory removal failed.
	  SGI bug#844219.

xfsdump-1.1.13 (11 January 2002)
	- fix xfsdump so that if an inode# is reused in the time
	  between building the inode map and pruning the inode map
	  (in phase 3 when some dirs are marked as not changed),
	  that it no longer aborts with an assertion failure.
	  SGI bug#846374.

xfsdump-1.1.12 (14 December 2001)
	- add new -B option to xfsrestore to correctly assign
	  ownership and permissions of the dump root directory
	  to the destination directory

xfsdump-1.1.11 (13 December 2001)
	- port back IRIX changes primarily to xfsrestore for
	  improving performance when one has over a million files
	- some extra mlogs (messages) for dump estimates,
	  dir tree diagnostics, type of dump format being used
	- various fixes for restore with multiple threads
	  and extended attributes (note: multiple threads not
	  implemented on Linux yet)

xfsdump-1.1.10 (10 December 2001)
	- fix xfsdump to endian convert all of the record header
	  fields properly just prior to writing the header out
	  (in particular first_mark_offset).
	  This caused do_next_mark() assertion failures at some
	  sites.

xfsdump-1.1.9 (28 November 2001)
	- fix xfsrestore so that it doesn't delete hardlinks
	  on alternate cumulative restores

xfsdump-1.1.8 (14 November 2001)
	- allow xfsdump to exclude files based on whether they have
	  a certain extended attribute set
	- don't include /var/lib/xfsdump in the dump

xfsdump-1.1.7 (18 October 2001)
	- xfsrestore -t will no longer fail if the current working
	  directory is not xfs
	- xfsrestore will no longer issue (harmless) warnings related
	  to space pre-allocation if it is writing to a non-xfs
	  filesystem

xfsdump-1.1.6 (03 October 2001)
	- get rid of useless stkchk abstraction
	  (will no longer get stack info messages with -v proc=debug)
	- FHS compliance for inventory directory (/var/lib/xfsdump),
	  and existing installations will continue to work as is.
	- A future xfsdump release will have an updated xfsinvutil to
	  allow the old directory to be migrated to the new manually,
	  without corrupting the inventory (its one or the other only
	  though, not both, and this is enforced by the tools)

xfsdump-1.1.5 (28 September 2001)
	- changes for ia64 (e.g. time32_t, getdents, librmt mtget changes)
	- fix dump/restore to be able to use drive_scsitape with devfs

xfsdump-1.1.4 (18 September 2001)
	- fix librmt to allow a remote path without "/dev" in its name
	- this allows xfsdump/xfsrestore to remote file
	- fix librmt for remote uname to use env variable RSH
	- add some diagnostics to xfsdump

xfsdump-1.1.3 (27 July 2001)
	- fixes for (hopefully) the last few nits in libtool usage

xfsdump-1.1.2 (24 July 2001)
	- merge in phase 3 changes from review and further testing
	- merge in code to specify maximum file size for xfsdump (-z)
	- merge in code to specify media file size for xfsdump (-d)
	- merge in code to request single media file for xfsdump (-S)
	- merge a couple of minor bug fixes from IRIX

xfsdump-1.1.1 (23 July 2001)
	- look for libtool archives in /usr/lib, not /lib

xfsdump-1.1.0 (18 July 2001)
	- rework package to use libtool
	- merge fsr bug fixes from IRIX
	- merge xfsdump phase 3 performance fixup from IRIX
	- enable use of (shared) libhandle.so and libattr.so
	- re-enable use of libdm.so for DMAPI support
	- remove some more unused "common" files
	- man page updates for xfsdump and xfsrestore
	- moved certain binaries from /usr/sbin into /sbin to
	  be available for recovery when only root is mounted

xfsdump-1.0.12 (13 July 2001)
	- Fix mistake introduced in 1.0.10 whereby xfsdump/xfsrestore
          to remote tape drives will cause rmt debug messages to be
          written to the remote machine in:
	      /server.XXX (where XXX = pid).
	  These files will no longer be created via xfsdump/xfsrestore.
          The fix is in librmt - it should have only written out
          warning messages and not debug messages.
          If the debug environment variable is turned on for librmt then
          the debug file will go to /tmp/librmt_debug.XXX.

xfsdump-1.0.11 (12 July 2001)
	- correctly restore block and character device major numbers

xfsdump-1.0.10 (05 July 2001)
	- produce librmt warning messages from xfsdump/xfsrestore
          without needing to set an environment variable

xfsdump-1.0.9 (15 May 2001)
	- correctly [xfs]restore the suid and guid mode bits

xfsdump-1.0.8 (12 May 2001)
	- added build dependency for Debian on latest devel package

xfsdump-1.0.7 (07 May 2001)
	- fix warnings, remove last -Wall filter
	- configure script default man path now /usr/share/man
	- support realtime files in dump/restore
	- cleanup arch-specific code, esp. the byteswab routines
	- as a result, move to -O1 as default for extern inlines
	- fix bug dumping to remote tape device with given user

xfsdump-1.0.6 (01 May 2001)
	- remove spurious warnings when dumping quota information

xfsdump-1.0.5 (09 April 2001)
	- fix use of an uninitialised variable in dump
	- fix a number of compiler warnings

xfsdump-1.0.4 (03 April 2001)
	- added xfsdump support for dumping quota information

xfsdump-1.0.3 (28 March 2001)
	- minor rpm spec file changes
	- added xfsdq and xfsrq for dumping quota information

xfsdump-1.0.2 (10 January 2001)
        - support extended attributes in xfsdump and xfsrestore

xfsdump-1.0.1 (30 January 2001)
        - minor rpm and deb packaging work

xfsdump-1.0.0 (15 January 2001)
	- dump, restore, fsr and co. abstracted from xfs-cmds package
        - completed Debian packaging
        - late beta code
